# skipper

Skipper is a stateful workflow engine framework library that allows you to define workflow as code without having to worry
about the underlying complexities of state management.

Skipper is designed with simplicity in mind. It is very lightweight and will run alongside your application binary and
its only dependency is a datastore (for now MySQL is the only supported datastore).
